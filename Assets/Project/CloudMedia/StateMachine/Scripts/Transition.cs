// üß™üìú TRANSITION ‚Äì THE GOBLIN THOUGHT PROCESS!
// This class is the magical bridge that helps goblins hop between states!
// It decides:
//   - Where the goblin starts (from state) - optional; without works as any state.
//   - When or why the goblin should switch (predicate ‚Äì a big IF).
//   - Where the goblin ends up (to state).
//   - How important it is (priority)
// State machine reads these and picks the best one based on brain + rule.
